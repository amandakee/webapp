    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    Parents face difficulty in selecting suitable places to bring their children to on the weekends that would meet the needs of every member of the family and allow them to spend quality time together. Different members of the family have different desired activities and needs, and a comfortable place for children requires some additional/unique facilities like changing rooms, nursing rooms and high chairs. This makes it challenging to check all the boxes. Parents feel tired even before the weekend, spending large amounts of mental energy to understand the family's needs and matching these needs to places. If not selected well, the weekend outing will be unsatisfactory or even unpleasant.

    <h1> Summary of User Research</h1>
    I interviewed 3 parents and generally found that it is indeed challenging to find places to go that would meet the needs of the entire family. Parents generally felt that it was tiring to make such decisions week after week, and a poor choice led to frustration and anger. Generally, it seemed that parents were looking for places where they could eat as a family and have space for the kids to play. Weather was also a huge factor - all parents cited airconditoining as a consideration.
